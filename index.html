            <p>The Skill-based group generator. This application was originally developed to assist Trilogy Education Instructional Staff in equally skilled classroom group generation. The initial app was developed as a node application that takes in an array of students and their skill and returns equal groups. A user interface is currently being developed in React and will have the ability for students to enter their own name and skill level.</p>

            <p>Skelly is an online tool that allows you to customize a skeleton for various project types. As a proof of concept, it uses various NPM packages to allow a user to customize the start of a project through a web interface. The structure is then delivered to the user as a zip file.</p>

            <p>I included my portfolio as a project because this application was one of my favorites to develop. Being able to customize my own website and show off my creative freedom was by far my favorite part. I went with a space theme after I found a space background codepen with moving stars, and rolled with it. Extremely happy with how this site turned out.</p>
